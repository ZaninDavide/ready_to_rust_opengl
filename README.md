# Ready to Rust openGL
This repository is meant to be used as a ready-to-rust starter pack for OpenGL. The window and the opengl context are created using [glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin). If you don't mind calling OpenGL functions yourself this repository is for you otherwise if you are looking for high level APIs consider checking out [glium](https://crates.io/crates/glium).

## Platforms
Although glutin can be setup for other platforms what you find here will work only on Windows. 

## Educational contents
If you are looking for more information I suggest that you take a look at the [official examples](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/tree/master/glutin_examples) of glutin. There are [great resources](https://learnopengl.com/) out there that will help you with your OpenGL journey and many of those are in C++ but they can be useful for us rustaceans too.
